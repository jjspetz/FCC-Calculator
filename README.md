# FCC-Calculator
This is my advanced front-end project for [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com). I put a lot of work into it so i decided to add a version to githubs. The orginal can be seen on [codepen](http://codepen.io/jjspetz/full/OWXoeO/).

### Built-with
HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery

### Lessons Learned
1) I had to use the JS eval() script for this project, so I spent a lot of time reading about the benefits and the potential security risk of using this script. I believe for a calculator where the user input is limited to numbers the security risk is negligible.

2) This project also taught me the value of localizing my assets as links I used in my code have broken down more frequently than I originally anticipated.
